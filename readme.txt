Binary MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) Woocommerce Software has been design with the advance features that will help the customer to make the high profit gain. We have integrated e-commerce using Woocommerce plugin, with MLM plans which is proving to be a dynamic in global market .


== Description ==

A Binary MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) structure is a specific type of compensation plan in the MLM business model. In this structure, each member or distributor recruits and sponsors two other distributors, forming two "legs" or "downlines." These distributors further recruit their two distributors, and the process continues, creating a tree-like structure.

Woocommerce is an e-commerce platform that operates as a plugin on WordPress websites. It facilitates the creation of online stores, allowing users to sell products and services.

Combining a Binary MLM structure with Woocommerce means setting up an online business platform where individuals can sell products or services while also earning commissions and bonuses through the MLM structure. In such a setup, distributors can sell products through their personalized online stores built on Woocommerce, and they can earn commissions not only from their sales but also from the sales generated by their downline distributors.

The integration of Binary MLM with Woocommerce typically involves setting up specific functionalities within the online store that track sales, manage commissions, and bonuses based on the MLM structure's rules and regulations. There might be additional plugins or software required to manage the complexities of the MLM compensation plan within the Woocommerce platform.
